## What is this? 
Wayne Burlingames' Jekyll Template on GitHub Pages
### What is Jekyll?
Jekyll is one of many of a slew of templating systems.
There are hundreds, possibly thousands of free templates.
So, if you want to "Tinker" just grab and install a template and tweak and modify to your needs/desires.
Jekyll web pages, in my opinion are best used when needing a solid, stable web page that does not need to change often. An example would be HowTo Docs or FAQ site.
### About Jekyll Templates 
Here is the awesome thing about Jekyll Templates...
You create your template, modify as needed...
Github will run Jekyll and can rebuild the page for your site, or multiple pages.

### Template Simplicity
Jekyll Templates can look very nice, and be complicated or very simple, and they look nice.
### Managing Site Pages
You also do not have to go through the full steps of :

1. Getting a domain
2. Web Hosting 
3. Building a full-feature website like a Wordpress site
4. Other complications
5. Security is decent because Github is actively taking care of the security

### Simple
Simple, Easy, So let's do it the easy way.
If you use Visual Studio or similiar DEV tools you can nearly automatically pull the Jekyll page files, edit them then click Git Push option and you will see website changes within 1-2 minutes.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/wayneburlingame/_A_Portfolio_in_Jekyll/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown & editing pages

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. Lookup markdown cheatsheet and start testing and tinkering. Pretty FUN STUFF! :)
