### Wayne Burlingames' Jekyll Template on GitHub Pages

## Here is the awesome thing about Jekyll Templates...
You create your template, modify as needed...
If you only modify let's say the README file, Github can rebuild the page for your site, or multiple pages.

### Jekyll Templates can look very nice, and be complicated or very simple, and they look nice.
### You also do not have to go through the full steps of getting a domain, Web Hosting, aWordpress site or other complications.
### Security is decent because Github is actively taking care of the security.

###Simple, Easy, So let's do it the easy way.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/wayneburlingame/_A_Portfolio_in_Jekyll/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/wayneburlingame/_A_Portfolio_in_Jekyll/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
