# _A_Portfolio_in_Jekyll
A personal Jekyll portfolio page, nothing more, nothing less, and rarely used.
Viewable URL is at:
https://wayneburlingame.github.io/_A_Portfolio_in_Jekyll/

## Usage
I created this page simply to test out Jekyll Templates.
One think I would like to mention is that with the use of Visual Studio or other tools with Git integration is the simplicity of editing web pages.
Pull the repository files, edit the web page, and then Push back to github, and web page changes show up in less than 2 minutes.
Awesome! :)
